    """Cross-platform desktop notification emitter

    Uses different backends depending on the platform version and available services.
    All implementations will dispatch notifications without an event loop but will
    require a running event loop to execute callbacks when the end user interacts with a
    notification. On Linux, an asyncio event loop is required. On macOS, a CFRunLoop *in
    the main thread* is required. Packages such as :mod:`rubicon.objc` can be used to
    integrate asyncio with a CFRunLoop.

    Callbacks to handle user interactions with a notification can be specified either at
    the class level, where they take the notification identifier as input, or directly
    on the notification itself. The latter will take precedence if set.

    Note that handlers that are directly set on the notification are tied to Python
    notification instance and therefore the app's lifecycle. Handlers that are set on
    the class level may run also for interactions with a notification while the app was
    not running, if DesktopNotifier is instantiated at app startup.

    :param app_name: Name to identify the application in the notification center. On
        Linux, this should correspond to the application name in a desktop entry. On
        macOS, this argument is ignored and the app is identified by the bundle ID of
        the sending program (e.g., Python).
    :param app_icon: Default icon to use for notifications. This should be a
        :class:`desktop_notifier.base.Icon` instance referencing either a file or a
        named system icon. :class:`str` or :class:`pathlib.Path` are also accepted but
